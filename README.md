### Purpose:
#### The Character Tracker page will serve as the main webpage where users can record their progress and preferences regarding Genshin Impact characters. It allows users to indicate which characters they already own and which characters they wish to obtain. This page collects user input through an interactive HTML form and saves the data locally on the user’s device for later use across the website.
