### Description:
#### This website serves as an informative guide about all current five-star characters in Genshin Impact as of 2025. It aims to provide players with detailed character profiles that include their background information, recommended artifact sets based on character attributes/stats, and suggested weapons for great performance. Each character section will also feature an image for easy recognition. 

#### Overall, the projectâ€™s goal is to create an informative and engaging platform that allows players to both enhance their gameplay and appreciate the depth of each character. The website will be heavy on content, featuring a simple yet attractive interface for those who will use it.

### Website Breakdown:
#### Home Page: 
> This webpage will feature our logo, the title, clear navigation bar that will link to our different webpages, and 6 naviagtion buttons that will link to the 6 nations. There will also a footer that will include our names, and credits to the surces we got the information from.

### Extra notes:
#### JS incorporation:
The main logic of our webpage will center around being able to search the character's names through an ID, and using a filter mechanic. This filter mechanic involves sorting the characters by the seven elements according to their vision (Anemo, Geo, Pyro, Cryo, Hydro, Electro, Dendro) and their weapon types (Polearm, Sword, Claymore, Catalyst, Bow).  This will manifest in clicking the icon on the left side of the webpages featuring the nation and its characters. The characters without the desired ID type will be filtered out, and be hidden from display until the user toggles it on. The user will be able to toggle the filters as well. A maximum of three filters can be achieved (nation, weapon type, and element).
